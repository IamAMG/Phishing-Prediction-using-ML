# 🛡️ Phishing Prediction using ML

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict phishing websites using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features of websites, the model can classify whether a website is legitimate or a phishing attempt. The project leverages various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to achieve high accuracy in predictions.

## Features ✨
- 🔍 **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms for phishing detection.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**: Extraction and selection of relevant features from websites to improve model performance.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to clean and preprocess the data before training the models.
- 📊 **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models.
- 🖥️ **Prediction Interface**: A user-friendly interface to input website data and get predictions.

## Setup Instructions 🛠️
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/IamAMG/Phishing-Prediction-using-ML.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd Phishing-Prediction-using-ML
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀
1. **Prepare your dataset**: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format required by the project.
2. **Training the Model**: Run the training script to train the model:
